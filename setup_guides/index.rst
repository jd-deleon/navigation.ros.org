- Help people with custom built robots to properly set up their robots to be used in ROS/Navigation2
- Act as a checklist, template or boilerplate reference for more experienced readers
- Provide examples which can be run on simulators/tools like Gazebo or RViz to guide readers on the Nav2 setup process even without a physical robot.
- Broad strokes tips and tricks for configuring certain packages and integrating different components of the robot platform (sensors, odometry, etc.)
